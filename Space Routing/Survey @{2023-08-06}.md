### Motivations
1. Traditional routing protocol for terrestrial mobile networks lacks support to LEO constellations.
	* LEO networks feature with a regular topology and long propogation delay.
	* Traditional stop-wait ACK mechanism will bring about long e2e delay due to the long waitting for ACK messages

### Metrics
1. end-to-end delay 
2. traffic distribution
